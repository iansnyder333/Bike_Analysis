* [Task 1] access historical bike rental data for 2021 from HealthyRidePGH and summarize the rental data  
* [Task 2] create graphs to show the popularity of the different rental stations, given filter conditions  
* [Task 3] create graphs to show the rebalancing issue  
* [Task 4] cluster the data to group similar stations together, using a variety of clustering functions and visualize the results of the clustering.
